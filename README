Java implementations of the graph algorithms.

The file node-edge-data.txt contains the node and egde data suitable for importing into Cassandra.

>cassandra-cli -h <host> -f node-edge-data.txt

This will create 3 column families:
Nodes - The node metadata
Edges - Directed, unweighted edges
WEdges - Undirected, weighted edges. There are only edges for one direction.

Compiling:
Add the cassandra jar files via brent -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add External JARs...

I think Eclipse might be silly and use absolute paths for this.

cqlsh.jar is a runnable cql client. Pass the host as an argument. It's really primitive.
>java -jar cqlsh.jar localhost
